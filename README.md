## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
> [!NOTE]
> The following shows the various ways that SeqCraft can be installed (currently there is installation support only from the binary releases and building directly from the source).

### Binary Releases
Download pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/joushvak17/SeqCraft/releases).

### From Source
If you want to build directly from the source then you can do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/joushvak17/SeqCraft.git
cd SeqCraft
go build .\cmd\app\main.go
```
Then, you can call the `main.exe` output file to run the program.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
The following shows the features that hopefully will incorporated in the future:
- Sequence Translation: Translate DNA/RNA sequences to protein sequences
- Motif Search: Search for specific motifs in sequences
- Sequence Alignment: Pairwise sequence alignment and support for MSA
- Secondary Structure Prediction: Predict secondary structure of protein sequences
- Phylogenetic Analysis: Construct phylogenetic trees from sequence data
